Welcome to My Games Website!

Thank you for visiting and playing my games! This website is a collection of classic arcade-style games. I appreciate your support and hope you enjoy playing.

About the Website
This website hosts a selection of three classic games: Minesweeper, Breakout, and Snake. Each game is built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, featuring a clean and user-friendly interface. I have also utilized Font Awesome (https://fontawesome.com/) for icons to enhance the visual appeal.

Games Overview

üéØ Minesweeper
Minesweeper is a logic-based puzzle game where players uncover tiles to find hidden mines. The numbers on revealed tiles indicate how many mines are adjacent. Clear the board without detonating a mine to win!

This implementation was inspired by ImKennyYip's Minesweeper (https://github.com/ImKennyYip/Minesweeper).

üèóÔ∏è Breakout (Coming Soon!)
Breakout is a brick-breaking game where you control a paddle to bounce a ball and clear bricks. Stay tuned for its release!

üêç Snake (Coming Soon!)
Snake is a classic game where you control a growing snake, trying to eat food while avoiding collisions with itself. More updates coming soon!
